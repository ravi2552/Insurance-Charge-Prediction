Welcome to the Insurance Charge Prediction repository! This project involves building a machine learning model to predict insurance charges based on various factors, and deploying the model using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

# Overview
This repository contains the code for developing a machine learning model to predict insurance charges. The model is trained on a dataset containing various factors such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The application is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input their details and receive an estimated insurance charge.

# Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Interactive web application using Streamlit
- User-friendly interface for inputting data and viewing predictions

# Usage
- Open the Streamlit application in your web browser.
- Enter the relevant details such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.
- Click the "Predict" button to get the estimated insurance charge.

# Model Details
The machine learning model used in this project is based on a regression algorithm. The following steps were taken to develop the model:

 - Data collection and cleaning
 - Exploratory data analysis
 - Feature engineering
 - Model training and tuning
 - Model evaluation and selection

The dataset used for training the model is publicly available and contains the following features:

 - age: Age of the primary beneficiary
 - sex: Gender of the primary beneficiary
 - bmi: Body mass index
 - children: Number of children covered by health insurance
 - smoker: Smoking status of the primary beneficiary
 - region: Residential region of the primary beneficiary
 - charges: Medical costs billed by health insurance
